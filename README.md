<h1> # Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution </h1>

<p>This is a solution to the [Single price grid component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc).</p> 
<p> The challenge consisted of replicating the static jpg design using CSS and HTML. By the end of the challenge, the user should be able to view the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size and see the hover state on desktop for the Sign Up button.

<h2>Learning Log</h2>
<h3>19oct2021 18:00</h3>
<p>Started the challenge using the static .jpg as a guide. I'm going to try and tackle this using only FlexBox for it is what I'm most familiar with. However, I think it should have been solved using Grid, but I haven't learned grid yet.</p>
<h3>19oct2021 19:00 </h3>
<p>At first, everything was going great. I built the whole layout for the desktop design with flexbox and it worked just fine. I hade one problem which was I couldn't, for the life of me, make the container border round!? Even though I have managed it just find in previous challenges/assignments/designs, for some reason it was most <em>NOT</em> working on this challenge.  If I apply the CSS border: solid red on everything, it shows me the bordes rounded.... maybe I have to round the .first-section container? Haven't tried that yet... But it doesn't seem logical to me. I'm going to try that anyway.</p>
<h3>19oct2021 19:15 </h3>
<p>Applying the border-radius to the .first-section solved the rounded border problem! I think I know why it didn't work: the .first-section sits <em>on top of</em> the .container, so the border <em>was</em> rounded, I just couldn't see it. I'm packing it for today and work on mobile responsiveness tomorrow.</p>
<h3>20oct2021 10:30</h3>
<p> While making the page resposive for mobile, I encountered a problem which I can't seem to find a solution! The .second-section doesn't align with the first one when squeezed into a small screen. At this point, I keep thinking will only be able to solve it with grid, for a have tried a couple of diferent css properties and nothing seems to work.</p>



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
